# Crypto Calculator

A Rust program for cryptocurrency calculations, specifically for Solana (SOL) and lamport conversions.

## Features

- Convert SOL to Lamports
- Convert Lamports to SOL
- Calculate transaction fees based on number of signatures

## Usage

```bash
cargo run# Crypto-Calculator
Cryptocurrency unit converter for Solana blockchain. Converts SOL ↔ lamports and calculates transaction fees based on signature count. My first Rust project focused on type safety and precision arithmetic.
